Because of that, the point of sunrise and sunset at the solstices of the third millennium BC had to be slightly different from what we can observe today.",

        "In 1963, the Anglo-American astronomer Gerald Hawkins argued that the alignments that had to be observed were much more, both the motion of the Sun and of the Moon. Hawkins also thought that Stonehenge was like a calculator for solar eclipses and that it was necessary to look at the Aubrey holes to find the mechanism by which it was possible to predict them. Among other things to calculate suspicious alignments he used one of the first computers,  with which he simulated the positions of sunrises and sunsets of both Sun and Moon around 1500 BC.",

The Station stones seem to describe a rectangle in which the two short sides are in the same direction as the axis of the monument and point towards the sunrise and sunset of the solstices. The two long sides instead point instead where the Moon rises and sets at the lunastice (the moment in which the satellite reaches the maximum inclination value with respect to the celestial equator) and in the case in which the lunar dawn occurs more southeast as possible.",

        "It isnâ€™t possible to exclude that the reason of the location of Stonehenge was chosen precisely because of that, but an action of this type would have required many repeated measures over the years and an almost scientific methodological approach that could be extemporaneous for the men of the time and, if there had been, then it is not clear why a region still further south, towards the English Channel, was not chosen.",
